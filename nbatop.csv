Investment Strategy Discussion,8,lozqyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lozqyt/investment_strategy_discussion/,16,2021-02-21,"Hey Topshot friends. First post here! Wanted to create a thread to discuss top investment strategies in the marketplace right now. 

As early investors in a digital sports collectible movement that, in my opinion (and Mark Cuban‚Äôs), will explode over the next few years, we all stand to make some serious dough here. Figured we should share our cumulative knowledge someplace.

Do you prefer concentrating your investment cash into a smaller group of more valuable moments (low serial #s, small edition moments, MGLEs, elite players, etc.) or a larger group of slightly less valuable moments (S1 and S2 base cards, solid but not top tier players, higher serial #s, etc.)?

Which moments have you guys been going after? Are you making gains flipping, or would you agree that holding is the way to go?

Personally: I have targeted S1 base all-stars with lower serial #s, and triple badge rookies, with the intention of holding for the foreseeable future. I have a feeling these may end up increasing in value significantly as Series S3, S4, S5+ come out over the next few months with much higher moment counts."

Cool Cats: Herro: $499, Randle: $330, Cousins: $300, Wall: $330, PJ Washington: $298

Base Sets: Barton: $170, S. Johnson: $75, Porter Jr: $67, TJ McConnell: $39, Bledsoe: $34

Total Cost RN: $2,142

(The most expensive Legendary Moment you could get for this or less would be $1,999 Serge Ibaka: [https://www.nbatopshot.com/listings/p2p/3a0ae6ce-f22e-4d98-b1fe-906f859df983+f32deb18-b2ff-4191-b1b7-904a86eaed0e](https://www.nbatopshot.com/listings/p2p/3a0ae6ce-f22e-4d98-b1fe-906f859df983+f32deb18-b2ff-4191-b1b7-904a86eaed0e) ; let's use this as a benchmark for arguably the best way to spend that money for the long-term, otherwise.  You could also get J. Wiseman, P. Williams, & Lowest Ask KD for like $2079, too)

\[Don't Hate the Player, Hate the Game...\]  I am personally holding all 10 of these moments myself (as well as going for the Cool Cats Master Challenge Reward), with the assumption 90% of NBATS Collectors willing & able to complete the AD Cool Cats Challenge are only going to want to sell it for at least what they paid to Mint it for.  (Some people got in way cheaper, but most people had to buy 4/5 Cool Cats, only getting 1 from a pack)  So what did everyone on average pay for the Cool Cats 10 Moments to Complete this challenge?  Someone can get a better number with data & math, I am supposing they spent on average $1,600 or so, so I assume that will be the Lowest Ask around 1 week after it's Minted.  (I suggest buying it for anything under $1,000 to start.)

If you buy in for $2,142, I expect you to be able to sell this AD for a minimum of $1,600.  I honestly think it could be closer to 1/2 of whatever the Cool Cats Luka Moment ends up being, as there were 5,000 Cool Cats each for #1 Challenge, and there are 10,000 Cool Cats each for the AD Challenge.

Luka Cool Cats Challenge #1 Reward Moment is currently Lowest Ask: $4,699, which would put AD at closer to $2,350, \~1/2 the price.

However, I think more than 2x will be minted, though.  I am guessing closer to 7,777 total Anthony Davis Cool Cats Challenge Reward Moments Minted.

This doesn't even account for the fact that this AD Moment will be a Requirement for the Cool Cats Master Challenge, which has LaMelo FREAKING Ball as the Reward!  Maybe the amount of People going for LaMelo will be much less than the amount of AD Cool Cats Challenge Rewards Moments Minted, but I think that's too much FUD for me.  Make a play, get rewarded.

LaMelo Ball's Current Only Moment, which will get a Rookie Badge soon, TBF \[But... Won't his Cool Cats Master Challenge get a Rookie Badge, too?!?\]  His 1 moment now is /LE 4,000 & hovering around $3,000 Lowest Ask, with #72 selling for $8,999!

I think, and I'm literally betting, that the LaMelo Ball Cool Cats Master Challenge Reward Moment will be one of the most sought-after moments on NBATS once the Beta is over & ads start happening.  If he wins ROY, etc... Look out!

So, as people who want to Complete this Cool Cats Master Challenge ([https://blog.nbatopshot.com/posts/cool-cats-master-challenge](https://blog.nbatopshot.com/posts/cool-cats-master-challenge)) to get this LaMelo ball magical moment Reward will need all the Cool Cats Moments, including this Anthony Davis you will be minting.

If you have not Minted your own NBA TopShot Moment, it is a huge nervous excitement waiting for the Challenge to end, I did it with Luka, & then waiting for Monday, or whenever it ends up being, for them to Mint  your exclusive Reward Moment and gift it into your Collection.  Having a ""True $0"" cost entry to a Moment is such an exhilarating feeling as you essentially get infinite profits, as you didn't even pay for a pack.  Seriously, watching Luka go up from Minting it myself is a wonderful feeling; I highly recommend it if you can afford it, while knowing you can't have that cash back for like 3-6 months.

(Yes, it's $2200 lol, but that's truly only the cost of the10 other moments you still keep & sell when you want, & yes prices go way down for a bit after the challenge ends)

I think the Cool Cats will all have even more value as the timeline approaches for the LaMelo at the end of the Master Challenge.

What do y'all think?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I think you can spend $2,142 for the Cool Cats 10 moments needed to get Anthony Davis Reward Moment, which I currently value somewhere between $1,600-$2,350, within a month or so, plus you have probably $1,071 worth of the other 10 moments to sell ASAP (I anticipate you can quickly get 50% back for them all), or you can hold them until you breakeven or better within a year or two, IMO.

This investment will pay off.,7,lomvyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lomvyd/this_investment_will_pay_off/,14,2021-02-21,"Dear Retards, 

**The Catalyst is upon us! The next Nba player to mention top shots will be bigger than you could ever imagine.**

We will wake up and realize how early we were. I believe we are going to wake up in the next few weeks to growth far greater than the current trajectory I'm talking about logan paul live streaming buying cards. The whole 2k community coming in. Tv advertisements about top shots or talked about on ESPN.  82k users on discord is quite large but 200-300k is much more reasonable. 70k users on site. 150m sales. We will be heading towards 5b in sales and 500k users by the end of March. The future is bright gentleman seize this opportunity you are early. Ok, mouth breathers I've given you a vision for the first time in your life now what should we buy?

Investments I recommend:

\[series 1 > series 2\]

Any OG series 1 retired player \[Chauncey/Dirk\[i own him\]/Duncan/Manu/Parker/Nash\]

Bulk common moments with high desired players \[Lonzo/Lamelo/Bridges/Wall\[plenty more\]

Buying lamelo ball is a 10-year risk-adjusted assuming lamelo is the future of NBA and internet cards have a future.

Jimmy Butler finals moment it seems criminally under-owned @ 5k I think this is a 25k moment stealing the ball from LeBron come on now \[this is the riskiest buy due to low liquidity but I think it's underappreciated\]

DD: I own Dirk/Giannis MVP dunks \[i am personally invested and own these.\]

I'll see you in 30 days gentleman.

**This is not financial advice** I am retarded and have no friends listening to this advice is a choice to gamble on stupid internet cards your wife could divorce you!

"S1 Gold ($500-$1,000) Analysis and My General Thoughts",27,lom28p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lom28p/s1_gold_5001000_analysis_and_my_general_thoughts/,28,2021-02-21,"Edit: I updated all of the 2x ratios I found yesterday in the attached sheet. Of the 17 I found yesterday, 7 of them dipped below the 2x. Two moments, Buddy Hield and Dennis Schroder had nice run ups in their S1 Bases but no movement in their MGLE at all. Both have Common market caps almost 4x higher than their MGLE cap.

\------------------------------------------------------------------

I've become a bit of an S1 Gold bug. I shared that I thought the S1 CJ McCollum MGLE was severely undervalued at $685 and it is now $2799 low ask as I write this. The gold climbed 308% while the common has ""only"" climbed 144%. Can't speak for every Gold - but my Gold is ""catching up"" projection appears to have some legs in my spot checks.

I sold an Early Adopter Conley and a Kevin Porter Jr. S1 Common to add some funds to my Dapper Balance. I think the Golds have a lot more value than challenge cards (""Early Adopters,"" ""Cool Cats,"" etc..) which is why I sold Conley. It also felt weird to have a moment worth over $200 for a G-League player (even though I'm really rooting for Porter to get his career on track and his moment to get to Lebron status).

I wanted to see any value plays I had in the $500-$1k range in S1 Gold  now that I had some Dapper cash and ran my #'s on the attached sheet:[ ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxdiQn1FNZSderpHemu7U7YbrfxQSb1hJdsbjflmIQ8/edit?usp=sharing)[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxdiQn1FNZSderpHemu7U7YbrfxQSb1hJdsbjflmIQ8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxdiQn1FNZSderpHemu7U7YbrfxQSb1hJdsbjflmIQ8/edit?usp=sharing)

* Top 5 (non-Rookie) value moments I found: Jarrett Allen, Seth Curry, Maxi Kleber, Marvin Bagley III, and Andre Iguodala
* Rookie craze is trickling into Golds but still a lot of potential opportunity: Jarrett Culver is the best Gold value here with PJ Washington in the Top 5.
* This analysis led me to buying Demar DeRozan - his Gold is severely undervalued IMO and he has 2 fan bases! (Pretty sure Toronto loves the man with all their heart!) Not telling you to buy DeRozan at all - that's where I went as a value seeker and fan

Buying your first Gold is scary as hell! Not trying to pump any player- but encouraging to look at the value before buying - and maybe using this approach as a guide.

Even if you don't agree with my 1:1 market cap ratio theory, I hope this helps at least compare to other players.

My advice: Find a player you love then check the gold market cap vs. common market cap to see if it pencils out. A 1.56 ratio on a player you root for every day is a hell of a lot more fun that ""taking advantage"" of a 2.73 ratio on a player you can't stand. The $ part of this is obviously fun as it has gone vertical during beta, but what is going to make this last is our irrational love for these players and teams. Cryptopunks and Cryptokitties are lame as hell to me but I appreciate how they got us here.

Sorry for the novel!

How-To For Pack Drops!,4,lnzn05,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lnzn05/howto_for_pack_drops/,19,2021-02-20," Establish connections with other users and/or follow the discord so that you get information on when the drops are supposed to happen. Be patient. They take a long time, and sometimes, they don't happen anywhere near the originally planned start time or date. It's mostly about luck. Recently, when the Pack becomes 'available,' you are able to ""Join the Drop"" by clicking on a big purple(?) button in the page to buy the pack itself. Typically, after that you wait for everyone to have a chance to join the drop, too. What was it? 90 minutes or so last time? Then, you get placed randomly into a queue. You get your place in line, and you know how many packs there are of each drop. You should likely, but not certainly, get a pack if you are in queue when a pack drop amount exceeds your position, as they do not want bots or anybody buying more than 1, I believe it was 6/40,0000 last time or so that got multiples. Just in case, and this might not work, screenshot your place in line when you start, so that if you miss out on a pack that you should get mathematically, you can send a support request to dapper. Worth a shot... Try to stay on the same screen for the remainder of your time to keep your place in line. Obviously, you want to be already logged-in top topshot before the drop, just in case they do it differently. Have money in your dapper balance in your account, imo. Common packs have been $9 and Cool Cats $14. Legendary ones are $999 and have been like $270 before. Dapper balance is the way to go, IMO. And buy any pack that you can easily afford to buy. I used to be able to buy packs like freely at $9... I am kicking myself for everyone I missed out on. Cost me so much more in entry fees to the market later for waiting, ultimate fomo. If you need to use a Credit card, have a completed moment purchase from the marketplace before the drop, still $5 moments, I think. Your bank gets to meet topshot and complete a checkout before you need it ASAP for the pack, just in case. This might also help you get a ""gift"" later for having made a marketplace purchase apart from a pack, as with the current ""gift"" challenge moments. You likely just get the one pack. They may let you sell unopened packs in the future, but the fun of topshot is opening the packs. Seriously, it's pretty freaking cool! I love it! (SOUND ON AS LOUD AS YOU LIKE IT! :)) Record opening it with your reaction, just in case, if you like that sort of thing... Get your friends and family involved in TopShot.

Value Investment: Retired Players,3,lnwyic,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lnwyic/value_investment_retired_players/,10,2021-02-20,"I‚Äôve been tying to determine which moments are the best investment for long term. I‚Äôm not looking to flip moments or constantly check topshot. I‚Äôm looking to buy and old moments for a decade. 

I‚Äôve found that retired players do carry a premium, but have much fewer in circulation. 

Reading the latest blog post, it looks like moments of ‚Äúrookies‚Äù and ‚Äúsuperstars‚Äù will be constantly be getting released. Each active player in the NBA will be getting new moments every base set. Unlimited supply 

It does not appear many retired players will be getting more moments. 

Veterans have very few moments. Most of them only have one moment from S1.  

I‚Äôve parked my money in future hall of famers and am going to let it ride.

Nash
Pierce 
Carter

Future CoolCats speculation,2,lnpzmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lnpzmh/future_coolcats_speculation/,7,2021-02-19,"I'm seeing a lot of speculation on who will be the next Barton etc, the first coolcats seem to have been players who have had a cat based team mascot in the past... I'm not sure if there's enough players to fit the bill for two more coolcats challenges there (despite the prevalence of wildcats teams in the usa)

Some future guesses, that seem to be gaining steam are Robin Lopez's goofy moment, based on the idea that perhaps they will look at players who own cats ([https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2019/07/01/enjoy-best-robin-and-brook-lopezs-cats-instagram/1616290001/](https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2019/07/01/enjoy-best-robin-and-brook-lopezs-cats-instagram/1616290001/))  


Lopez was trading under $10 today, and seems to have been eaten up by some whales, buying as many as possible hoping for the barton effect.

The other guess, is the Bismack Biyombo CC+ Moment, which has been selling for around 3/4 and has been jumping recently, on the idea that charlotte changed their name to hornets, but were previously cats...

"Need advice! Moment purchase did not go through, but I'm worried I am still getting charged.",2,lnpypj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lnpypj/need_advice_moment_purchase_did_not_go_through/,2,2021-02-19,"Hi everyone! I'm very new (much like a lot people) and I have fallen in love with NBAtopshot. After subscribing to the reddit page, I became more aware that certain technicalities are inevitable, so I'm not stressing about that. However, I attempted to buy moments that I did not receive, were declined, or simply was a few seconds behind another buyer, yet I'm worried I still may be getting charged. I foolishly believed the latter (that I was a tad late) which was why I did not receive the moment, so I kept attempting to buy. I then realized it may be an actual card issue, because I did not warn my bank ahead of time and thought they would think it was a case of a stole card/fraud, thereby cancelling my card. Part of that was true, because I was reaching my limit for the month (smh), but they said some of the moment purchases will be verified and go through, even though, as I've mentioned, I did not actually receive the moment. Basically, I got overzealous and excited at the prospect of buying moments and being apart of what, I believe, will be the vanguard of online sports card trading. I'm a huge NBA fan, so this has all be remarkably exciting, but I can also be impulsive. I guess that would be more useful to talk through with a therapist, then on a reddit post! Jokes aside, I was curious if anyone else has dealt with this issue. I tried to find contact information with Dapper, but can find an actual phone number. I'm worried I will be charged (even though I will be able to dispute), but first, I figured I would come here for any advice or wisdom in the event anyone else has dealt with this. Thank you everyone! I'm excited to be part of the community! 

Aside from all that I have said, I currently have a Zion, Dame, Jaylen Brown, Bam, Siakim, and Darius Garland moment: all series 2 and ranging from 1000-14,000 in regards to SN. Do those seem like good moments to have? Again, I'm a newbie and I imagine I must be the first new person to come here for advice (terribly, annoying joke). I hope everyone has some happy buying/selling today!

All advice is IMO, GL HF!)",10,lnasdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lnasdl/how_to_make_money_collecting_on_nba_topshot_or/,26,2021-02-19,"Be Patient.  Start Slowly and Small, relatively.  Ask for Help.  Read, absorb, discuss everything you can about NBA TopShot.  If you make money, plz LMK, and Pay it Forward!  Same goes for advice, drop info, etc... thanks :)

You should make a purchase from the marketplace for a CC+ $1, $2, or $3 first.  Pick a player you know or are interested in the moment itself.  You now own this piece of history, serially-numbered.  Don't worry too much about serial numbers, yet, though.  Give it a few weeks, just looking at prices.  However, know that CC+ moments are almost certainly going to have more of them made, whereas LE Moments are solidified at that count forever, which creates the scarcity that drives TopShot prices.  Most prices won't be going down too much, aside from some inflated Challenge requirement ones.  Demand will continue to increase as more people join over the next year, supply of LE moments will not.  

IF you can get any Pack, buy ANY pack you can afford.  Open it, you cannot safely sell unopened packs.  Pack drops are simpler if you have a dapper balance to use to buy them.  Have a completed transaction so your bank and dapper can meet before you get a chance at a pack.  

Pack Drops are the EASIEST way to make money on Dapper, but they are a whole 'nother animal.  DM me or hope I spend another hour writing something one-size-fits-all like this before the next one.

Don't obsess over serial numbers or drops in the first month.

IF you can complete any Challenge, do so.

Don't sell any of your moments unless you are upgrading to better ones.

Buy moments that you like them, appreciate the player, support the team, etc.  Household players, HOFers, Rookies (Moments will soon have Rookie Badges added), 6th Men, Potential Award Winners, big market teams, big market players, rising stars, moments with misprints or messed up stats, moments with record-breaking plays... you have to do your homework about the NBA, ESPN stats help, NBA 2k ratings, the Discord, my old posts.  It gets easy very fast, but be patient, go slowly.

There are a TON of opportunities to make money with purchases on the marketplace.

If you want to know a moment's 'Price' it's the ""Lowest Ask"" for the most part.  It's fairly simple supply and demand, but you can see the 'supply' and know what everyone else wants to get for their moments.  Moments are exclusively 'worth' what people will pay for them (we are in BETA still for 6 months at least, so be patient).  However, all Moment 'prices' are determined by Sellers.  Anyone who owns a moment can list it for sale at any price for any reason, within reason.

TopShot Economic Scenario: Moment X is available for $10, with 2 of them at this ""Lowest Ask: $10"" price.  You notice the other sellers all have prices of $40 or higher.  You purchase both of these $10 moments.  Now, the ""Lowest Ask"" is $40, so you have 2 moments you paid $20 'worth' $80 total.  Wait!  Now some Newbie 1 decides to cut and run so he lists at $35.  Newbie 2 then panics and lists for $30, and Newbie 1 lists his down to $30, too.  Your moments are now 'worth' $60 total.  So what do you do? Sell like a newb?  NO!  You buy these moments.  You now own 4 moments worth $160 total, as the new Lowest Ask goes up to $40 again, and no more Newbies try to undersell themselves (WHY DO PEOPLE DO THIS WITH MOST MOMENTS!?!?), and you only paid $80 for all 4.  As new investors join this market and want your Moment X, also... They have to pay the Lowest Ask, which is a decent price to a newcomer at $40.  All the ones under $50 are gone now, so you sat and stacked paper as your moments rose to $50 each.  You cash out 2 of your moments.  You have $100 in your Dapper Balance, or $95 with the 5% fee.  And you are up $15 in Profit, holding 2 moments now worth $100 total, or $50 each.  

TL; DR: Buy the best moments you can afford to hold for a year, hold them, study the marketplace and this subreddit (Mostly my posts if you want to see how people made money in real-time).  Easy-peazy, lemon-squeezy."

S1 Gold Analysis (and Why CJ McCollum Gold may be the Best Sub-$1k Snag on Top Shot),56,ln5w4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/ln5w4s/s1_gold_analysis_and_why_cj_mccollum_gold_may_be/,18,2021-02-19,"\*Quick Update 12:20PT\* I updated prices for all of the 2x opportunities I found last night and there are a lot less of them now - Golds appear to be catching up. The biggest ""undervalued"" golds compared to their base in this price range appear to be PG, Carmelo, Dwight Howard, CJ, Siakam and DeRozan. Siakam Gold got even more undervalued to the Base! He replaces CJ as my best Sub-$1k moment. If my bank account wasn't already pissed off at me I'd be all over it!

Also - if anyone has the skills to auto-generate prices from Top Shot into the Google sheets I have some other tool ideas up my sleeve. The data entry is killing me though!

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The latest *First Mint* Episode inspired me to take a closer look at the S1 Golds and start to develop the spreadsheet here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Q-NtIBxYO1qVsCMmABTEKj5BLWyLbm3nN7w4Yv2\_ec/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Q-NtIBxYO1qVsCMmABTEKj5BLWyLbm3nN7w4Yv2_ec/edit?usp=sharing)

Pretty much analyzing the S1 Gold Moment vs. the respective Base Moment (they are the same play in S1). This is a quick snapshot preview of the $400-$750 Gold price range - insane to think I would ever consider spending $4 on a highlight, let alone $750. Some quick points:

* CJ McCollum, Pascal Siakam, and Demar DeDerozan are the best ""Value"" Gold plays (in this price range) with the Common cap over 2x the Gold cap.
   * Edit: PG-13 Gold is the new ""value winner,"" with Melo and Dwight Howard Golds also looking strong.
* Malcom Brogdan, Markief Morris, and Marcus Smart are ""inverted"" where their Gold cap is more valuable than their Common cap.
   * Edit: Fox and Boganovic are added to Golds ""overvalued"" - although if you can score this Common Fox under $400 - do it!
* The ""Rookie Craze"" has not yet hit S1 Golds - highlighted by Jordan McLaughlin and Jarrett Culver in this price range and 90% of other S1 rookies in my analyses.
   * Edit: More Rookie Craze in revised price range! Rui, PJ Washington, and Colby White are biggest Common/Gold ratios (although the first two are likely due to Cool Cats)

Long time Reddit lurker - but NBA Top Shot has inspired my first ever Reddit post. I whole-heartedly believe in the future of this product and am really excited for the future as a collector, NBA fan, and crypto amateur (wish I would have known earlier). I bought my First Top Shot at the end of January after listening to the Mismatch Podcast. There are a lot of dynamics I've started to incorporate with 538 player projections, other value play analysis, etc... If this gets enough love - I'd love to share more content

Dame for MVP!

But now I'm thinking that the gift challenge set may be more profitable when all is said and done, for reasons I'm sure have already been posted here such as a lower circulation for all the gift moments, this one kind of flying under the radar as opposed to the cool cats, etc. Which do you guys think will have the highest value for someone looking to sell off as soon as the challenge completes?"
Food for Thought about digital collectables vs cards,69,lmojla,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lmojla/food_for_thought_about_digital_collectables_vs/,66,2021-02-18,"\- Every moment is a PSA 10/10  
\- You don't have to worry about damaging a moment,    
\- You don't need physical storage space   
\- Unlike cards, moments are completely liquid and can be transfered nearly instantly - They literally cannot be replicated like cards can be because they are signed and serialized on the blockchain    
\- It's a gif of a moment rather than a still picture on a card  
\- No shipping/delivery costs other than the marketplace cut

I could go on forever. This is the future.  
And I'm saying that as a card/collectables guy."

These guys are massively overlooked imo as they're in the first set and have some quality players to name a few.

 Darius Garland

 Coby White
 
PJ Washington 

RJ Barrett - 4 badge

(Insert another not shit S1 rookie)

I feel like people are getting sucked in to buying some of the trash s2 rookies (see Jalen Smith) when the better value is S1.

Garland and White have approximately doubled in the last week across BOTH MGLE and common and will hold that s1 prestige.

What's your thoughts on the S1 rookies? Are you buying them? I certainly am"

Obviously we all know what happened with the drop getting pushed back multiple times and considering the amount in que (little north of 60k people I believe) and only 45k packs available, it did make for an interesting day and Discord chat LOL. I don't think any drop from last night is going to get anyone rich over night but I'm just happy to get a pack and some moments in my profile. 

I discovered Top Shot about a month and been browsing around since then, periodically reaching the checkout page multiple only to not pull the trigger. Right now I don't have the cash to drop thousands of dollars on the most desirable moments. Even some B-grade stars are going for lowest $15k a moment (holo, cosmic, etc), which I solely believe once beta ends we will see those values explode. I don't want to waste my time going for $10 moments and I'm not sure I will see the same ROI on those $200 type CC moments compared to the ones like the holo, cosmics, etc... which leaves me with going for pack drops. I would prefer much more to pay for $200 packs to potentially get a more valuable moment, but I'm wondering if I should still be picking up these early CC or decently priced LE's?

I'm curious what some of you are doing or would do with some money to invest but not the whole bank roll behind you like that guy that bought a Lebron moment for $100k just because he know it will go up.

Does that sound right to people?

I'm also seeing that only 5000 people total are able to withdraw, up from 2000. That seems small, based on how many accounts there are (e.g., \~112k people in queue for yesterday's CC pack drop). 

I'd appreciate any news here!

You can‚Äôt buy my rookie moments because they won‚Äôt be for sale anytime soon.,8,lkuplv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lkuplv/you_cant_buy_my_rookie_moments_because_they_wont/,7,2021-02-16,"Listen up jerk.

You‚Äôre spending all this time messing around with NFT basketball cards maybe because you think it‚Äôs fun or are trying flip a quick few dollars.  Whatever the case may be, you need to take a breathe and calm the Fook down if you somehow got your hands on a rookie moment on the cheap.  Who knows maybe you paid up.  No matter how you got it...

Do. Not. Sell.

1. Scarcity:  TopShot is currently a rare situation where demand is far exceeding supply. This will not last forever.  In fact, by the time it‚Äôs all said and done you‚Äôll be looking at some of the garbage being sold for real money right now and wondering how it ever happened.  The only commons that are worth anything long term are the ones with an obvious appeal, and only 1 thing in this base set series 2 makes any fooking sense as both desirable long term and somewhat scarce... Rookies.

They created the rookie edition size not realizing how fast they would scale and it‚Äôs way too small compared to how big common set LEs will be in the future once this shit explodes.  I have a hard time imagining any common set will even include rookie debuts in the future, and if they do it may not even be the good players. Suffice to say I think this was a rare windfall for early-ish adopters.

2.  Value/Upside:  We don‚Äôt know for sure if any of these players are good yet. This will make the price points on some of them look really cheap if they breakout. Few purchases you can make on the site have clearly massive ceiling potential compared to their current cost... rookies like Killian Hayes have that upside buy you could still see upside on a 1k LaMelo if he‚Äôs actually as good as he looks right the fuck now.

In other words - the worst you can do is lose your February mortgage payment on a handful of NFTs, and the best you could do is accidentally hold a moment worth 5 figures that you paid 3 figures for.

3. Badges - Each rookie‚Äôs first game moments will be receiving ‚ÄúRookie Debut‚Äù badges.  They haven‚Äôt been applied yet, and the morons of earth will all instantly assign more worth to these moments As soon as they see it has a special designation officially.  I think this is true even if they are aware they are coming soon.  Buy before the upside starts to diminish.

4. Liquidity - If you are paying some stupid amount of money for a moment just because they only made 99, you‚Äôll be sweating that in 2 years when they start releasing some of the best moments from NBA history - which the CEO himself told me in an AMA they purposefully withholding for the future.  Once they start pumping the real shit out, it will put your awful Patty Mills assist or the whatever to shame... and also be in a 99 edition size.  Wait until real value presents itself before you pay up for assets that you can‚Äôt sell in 2 years because nobody wants them (short of maybe the hardcore collectors).  I could be wrong about patty fucking mills, but guess who I‚Äôm really sure will be liquid in 5 years? Any rookie debut who turns out to be an NBA star.


Bottom Line:  I‚Äôm sure I can make up some additional bullshit on why I‚Äôm buying and holding common rookies from S2, but I‚Äôm exhausted from the stench of my own fraudulence. I‚Äôm not an expert and I don‚Äôt know shit.  However, what I just said makes perfect fucking sense to me... and thus you can‚Äôt have my rookie moments.  They aren‚Äôt for sale until they go to the moon... which is inevitable IMO üöÄ."

From my experiences in 2K, there tends to be a 'gatekeeper' card that ultimately controls how much the collection reward costs, and is often more expensive than its actual value.

Typically that gatekeeper card would be the one with the most limited availability (ie the rarest one), but considering that all the five cards are 8888, do you think this would be the case? Looking at Donovan Mitchell now since he seems to be the most expensive.

Thoughts?"

"Summarized interview with Dapper CEO. Tldr the NBA came to them, if license is pulled NBA and consumer would still own the content",19,lior4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lior4k/summarized_interview_with_dapper_ceo_tldr_the_nba/,1,2021-02-13,"I just watched an interview with Roham, CEO of Dapper Labs:

https://youtu.be/UbToTC6r9O0
¬†
#tldr; NBA came to them. Even if the NBA were to pull the license in the future, fundamentally speaking the assets and IP would belong to the NBA and the consumer and would transfer over. 

* Dapper have never had an outbound sale for the company, it's companies coming to them. The NBA came to Dapper labs.
¬†
* This is exciting for NBA because for the first time can sell something to their fan that's not a physical object. Selling a jersey, partner with manufacturers, at the end of the day it's a partnership with the fan. Have never been able to replicate that with digital, and their audience is online and digital these days

* How to sell to these people? Cards in ultimate team and 2k - when rules changes, games updated, go poof, sucks for the NBA as brand, and sucks for consumer that they keep buying stuff that they cant use and keeps going away, NBA don't want to put their IP (highlights) into these digital useless assets

* The power of blockchain is the NBA can create these digital assets, Dapper sure helps them sell it and helps operate the market place, but fundamentally because the goods are on the blockchain, the **NBA has the option to give the NBA license to someone else in the future and those good WOULD TRANSFER.**

* Practically Dapper is the only option today to bridge tech and creativity but at the end of the day structurally the power belongs to the brand and the consumer rather than Dapper as the tech provider

* Number are impossible to ignore, no brand that doesn't want a digital economy.

* Dapper doesn't want to be a single product company, here to evangelize a whole ecosystem. 

Long term road map: free to play NBA app to draw in casuals who will then be incentivized to buy moments to improve the game. Focus on stability right now for a 100x and another 100x in users. Once users are in the funnel, the conversion rate is huge."

Longer Term Holds,5,li98ho,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/li98ho/longer_term_holds/,29,2021-02-12,"Are there any reasonably priced long term holds your eyeing from the marketplace or already have that you think will increase in value substantially over the next 6-12 months as the platform gains more momentum and users?

I'm looking at the Curry S1 three (LE/3600).  Lowest price is around $400 right now.  As more packs are released it seems the ""CC"" (Circulating Count) could potentially have more cards added to their already high totals of +15k making them fun to collect but obviously not as rare.

I'd be eyeing the current LE cards and just like that Curry play in general and see him as being a top 5 desired player on the platform for a while.  

Any thoughts or others you see as being potential for good returns over the long haul?

Happy Collecting and may the pack drops be with you."

Where do I start?,6,lgwm37,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lgwm37/where_do_i_start/,8,2021-02-10,"I think this is an awesome idea. I think NTFs are huge and definitely have long term value, especially with the NBA seemingly taking good interest in the project. 

My question is where should I start. I've struck out on the last 3 pack drops, which clearly seem to be the best value. I would like to build my own collection as well as buy/sell/trade along the way.

If I cannot get my hands on packs and don't really have the money to buy multiple $100+ moments, what is the play? Looking at some super early adopters collections it seems they had access to packs and got in super low so I feel I'm light years behind even though it's still in beta. Looking for any kind of help for starting out and getting my feet wet. 

Appreciate all feedback."

Analysis of some of NBA Top Shot's competitive advantages as early of NFTs,36,lgowhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lgowhm/analysis_of_some_of_nba_top_shots_competitive/,31,2021-02-10,"Here are some reasons why I think this platform is going to be massive. There's lots of fear and doubt about the platform and it's future by people who don't quite get it but if you're here you're probably not one of them so I won't bother convincing you. I'm not here to talk about the basic benefits of blockchain but rather the signals that make me worry less as an investor. 

Here are some advantages that Top Shot has that make it poised to be big:

* NBA involvement. Not only does NBA licensing and selection of highlights give us relief that this isn't just a Ponzi scheme, it proves that growth is coming. 

* The NBA is incentivized to market this product massively to its fans because they take a cut of each transaction in fees. Before they only made money off video clip licensing of their media. If anyone remembers the early NBA.COM days, they have always been first of the big sports leagues to upload their video clips in an accessible manner and are media tech friendly. This is a potentially massive revenue stream for them off of content they already own. 

* IP pipeline. There is already a game in the works named NBA Top Shot Hardcourt that uses moments to fuel the game. This is proof that there's a long term plan for the product and ecosystem, and that there's a vision beyond just a website. 

* Flow. Cryptokitties stopped being viable because of Eth scalability issues. This is built on specialized Blockchain designed specifically for NFT scalability to address those concerns. Late players to the NFT market will be competing with a blockchain that already exists and has a massive market presence. 

* First product to bring blockchain mainstream. I work in IT consulting and we sell blockchain solutions to clients but there's never actually a use case that justifies it in the real world. This is the first time that usage of the blockchain actually enhances the value of a market segment that is widely reachable and in desperate need of digitization.

I didn't grow up opening cards. I also am not part of the Tiktok generation. But I know people who spend thousands on 2K or FIFA cards PER EVERY YEAR OF THE GAME. Imagine that revenue, with the value proposition of non fungible collectibility. 

Sorry, grandpa. The youth don't give a damn about holding physical cards. I've never owned a sports card before Top Shot, and I'm not that young. Imagine one day Devin Booker hits a game winning step back 3 in the playoffs and all everyone can do is tweet they can't wait to get the #TopShotMoment

As Cuban said, this is the future."

Prices are dropping. What should I do?,1,lebfhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lebfhx/prices_are_dropping_what_should_i_do/,16,2021-02-07,"Hi all,

Just seeking some advice. Got into top shot a few weeks ago when the prices were still going on the rise, and regret not selling the moments when they were at peak a week or so ago.

I only bought some of the cheaper moments cards, and also managed to get a couple of basic packs, as I wasn't willing to spend too much money on this. As a general example, Luka's CC assist moment was $150 lowest asking when I packed him but now he's $36 lowest asking.

Noting that I know I can't go back in time to sell my moments (pre-empting the unhelpful ""should've sold them"" replies), should I:

(1) just hodl onto them knowing that I spent the money understanding the risk of losing the money altogether, with the hope of the prices going back up in the long term, OR

(2) sell them now because prices will never go back up

FYI, I'm still in the green in terms of money spent vs sum of all the values of my moments around the serial numbers.

FYI2, all my moments are CC series 2 cards either packed or picked up cheap (or so I thought for a few of them) from the marketplace a couple of weeks ago when it arguably peaked. I have a few in the serial number less than 100, and a few 'big name' cards like Luka, AD, Giannis. And then another 20 or so moments bought on the cheap.

Any comments moving forward would be appreciated cheers"

Same with packs. Instead of individual packs and people buying everything up in blink of an eye, it should be handled by large blocks with much larger packs. Maybe blacks are represented by NBA team affiliation, idk.

I understand the disappointment, and I do have a number of separate issues with Dapper, but the anger I've seen on Twitter and other platforms in the last couple hours feels a bit disproportionate with what went down.

$1000 unused in Dapper?

Guesstimate of number of Luka‚Äôs to be minted: ~3,000 ([data‚Äôs a bit old, would expect an update tomorrow](https://twitter.com/PlungeFather/status/1357700043726327809) )

Looks like the next set of Cool Cats is minted to 10,000 per instead of the 5,000 ([Top Shot Explorer](https://topshot.renf.ca/sets/32)) 

So Luka may be able to provide return if lots of people are going for the master challenge, and may be a bottleneck as a relatively small number minted. 

If you‚Äôre thinking about the master challenge, one unknown is the number/availability of the  CryptoKitty moment (probably Karl Anthony-Towns) which is needed for the master challenge - however, some of the Top Shot staff have said that they dont think this will be the bottleneck and cited that they offered that moment to 70k active CK users, but we‚Äôll see.

Honestly, not sure why we can't withdraw at will even though depositing money is the quickest thing their site can process. Considering how slow the site is, I have to upload 1k if I want this pack, then get in line and hope I get it. If I don't? I'm out 25 bucks just for trying to get a pack and have to wait a month+ for my 975. Crazy.

That right there is going to be the downfall of these cards. Top shot is a great concept, but not knowing when you'll be able to get a sizeable amount of money back is pretty off-putting. I'm sure it will deter plenty of people.

I don't know what u think about it, but I feel that I wasted my money and my time by ""investing"" in their project, since the marketplace values are collapsing atm and I need to liquidate my funds and Moments that are in my Account.

Lottery was a good idea. Just fix the loophole/exploits.

But ultimately you guys need more cards, more commons, less ""great cards"" for this to scale. 

You're making a gacha game. Good gachas thrive on

1. Frequent and affordable opportunities to gamble.

2. Reasonable but not good chance of success (1/30- 1/50 you pull an S tier)

3. Pity timer system for those with terrible luck.

4. F2P opportunities to enhance success. 

So far Topshots has:

1. Not offered frequent chances to gamble. Pack drops are rare and even when they do drop you rarely get to buy the pack.

2. Far too good odds. Currys out the butt. Sorry but the user base is going to have to scale massively before any of these S2 moments are worth $.

3. I did like the apology cool cats pack for those of us who got effed repeatedly. 

4. Seemingly no F2P opportunities at all.

Mike Breen's ""BANG BANG"" call  would make Luka's step back 3 moment waaayyyyy better. Or for LeBron's Kobe dunk tribute, have a quick Lebron snippet talking about that moment.

You can do some other cool stuff like backdrop the moment with, I don't know, a popular track from Lil' John, or a sick rhyme from Dam Lillard.

I think adding game audio, real music, and player reactions would make these moments more valuable but, more importantly, even more fun!

All in on Cool Cats or invest elsewhere?,2,lapqcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/lapqcx/all_in_on_cool_cats_or_invest_elsewhere/,9,2021-02-02,"Edit 2: 1 left to buy and only $44.5 in my dapper wallet! I have 9 moments left to sell and have them all listed for great prices ... if I sell 8 of them I should be able to buy Collins and complete the challenge. 

Edit 1: I'm all in. I have Tobias, Booker and DJJ, still need Rui and Collins.

Selling everything I have at market low or if good serial then low relative to the nearest 500-1000ish. Username: WasabeWatanabe of anyone wants to look!
‚Äê----------‚Äê------------‚Äê----------‚Äê------------‚Äê----------‚Äê------------

Looking for some perspective / advice:

Debating whether trying to complete the cool cats challenge is worth it.

- I have Tobias Harris cool cat
- I've sold off moments so I have a dapper balance of $750
- I have 3 more moments with some value: Luka Cc, Danny Green s1 LE, Giannis s2 LE
- I can prob get about $250 for them 


So, should I attempt to go for broke on cool cats challenge? I'll maybe have enough if prices dip a bit more or I get deals.

Or, should I hold my good moments, sell Tobias and invest in undervalued moments? And just give up on cool cats. 

I'm finding it hard to figure out if the Luka reward + future cool cats value be more than playing it a bit more safe and holding what I have/buying up one or two great moments."

Says it was a bounce pass in the details for the moment, but it wasn't a bounce pass. The error is there on the 2681 base set and on the 250 So Fresh edition.

Price is already pretty high on the So Fresh LE's ($380+) but the base set is still reasonably cheap.  
Not sure what would officially make it a misprint but I thought it was worth pointing out if anyone else wants to jump on it. I'm pretty optimistic on the outlook on their value regardless of if people value them as a misprint, it's still so early and it's been literally impossible to get in on a pack drop.

It's been a little crazy these days let's just say things used to be a bit tame back in my time oh way back when I joined somewhere at the beginning of October feels like forever ago.

 Ahhh yes those were the days when Common base sets would linger for what felt like days and not 10seconds that everyone is used to today. Well let me tell ya some of us ""old dogs should've been feeding"" a little more as you can imagine like even up to the release of Series 2 the last couple Series 1 base drops were bought up tame in my eyes. What a blessing though to buy at rock bottom prices.

 My problem was I had the old mindset that anything common was trash lol just like in cardboard cards except for ya know the good ones. So I didn't keep or pick up like I should've boy was I wrong when I watch those trash cards go to today's evaluations. I was like damnnnn. It was not all lost though as I was able to grab a big moment or two with what money  I had and a few packs here and there but man what a ride.

my answer to recent pack drop issues - Single moment packs,0,l8fg5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/l8fg5v/my_answer_to_recent_pack_drop_issues_single/,1,2021-01-30,"So one thing I was thinking since we're having so many issues with pack drops...

The reason why everyone is getting their panties in a wad is because everything is not working correctly right now and the packs are worth sooo much more than they're charging, right? some people are getting lots of packs and others are coming up empty handed. So even though we all know topshots is beta, people get salty. 

Now, dapper needs to drop packs! they have to drop something to stress test the system right? But it would be nice to be able to drop packs without 1. flooding the market and 2. people getting all salty.

My answer to this is single moment packs with 1 ""okay"" LE moment. Charge like I don't know,  $4 for it. Maybe the moment is ""worth"" like $20 or so.

Why is this good?

1. keep it LE, and so the pack value is better than the price paid. this rewards stress testers with something nice and ensures that there is demand for the packs and stress on the system. 
2. only 1 moment in a pack stresses the system just as much as putting 3 in. It also keeps the market from dipping as hard since a third of the moments are dropped. Keeping moments as the ""okayest"" players means no one feels screwed ever. All packs are worth about the same. If you miss the stress test drop you know what you missed out on - the okayest moments. 
3. personally I think they should make it something new just for stress testers but that may be too much. Maybe something like a few unreleased 15000LE moments. It could literally be the same moment for everyone. everyone knows what they're getting. 

Anyway I know there are probably reasons why they couldn't do something like this. But it was just a thought. Of course, they could still drop base packs but I wish they'd do raffles or something like that. I hate seeing people get pissed of and such and I hate that things are lopsided like it is now. IMO the raffles/reservations are a great way to ensure things are fair and people are happy."

I feel like I'll seriously never be able to secure a pack. I think a lot of people will see $9 packs, think it's reasonable, and want to sign up and have fun with it, and then just give up after a day or two of realizing they can't secure one. 

I really think that initial little rush of opening a pack will be key to retaining people. If there's a marketing push before people have to ability to sign up and grab a pack their retention rate will be terrible. 

Also is there a technical reason why they don't let people list unopened packs on the marketplace? That could add another fun speculative dimension to the whole thing as well."

As part of this experiment, we‚Äôre offering the ability to reserve a pack to collectors who we know were trying to get in on the drop and weren't able to get one.

**""Rookie Moment badges will be applied retroactively to any Moment from a player‚Äôs rookie season. This includes rookies‚Äô playoff Moments. That is, all Series 1 and 2 rookie Moments will get this upgrade, regardless of tier or set.**""

[See this blog post](https://blog.nbatopshot.com/posts/rookie-badges) for more information on that, but there are three criteria to add additional flair to the moment:

1. **Was the Moment from the player‚Äôs rookie year?** 

*If so, this Moment will be identified with a rookie badge.*

2. **Was the Moment from the player‚Äôs NBA debut game?**

*If so, this Moment can carry extra value for collectors long-term and will have a little something extra on their rookie badge.*

3. **Was the Moment minted in the player‚Äôs rookie year?** 

&#x200B;

The LE moments that this apply to are:

I think all these cards will benefit from the badges being retroactively applied, but Obi and Jalen Smith make the most sense at their current prices. Add in the meteoric rise  of the Knicks and the fact that Smith hasn't been health and Frank K is terrible and I think this goes from a good play to a great play."

My Starting Strategy (Smaller Budget),19,l1j4kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/l1j4kn/my_starting_strategy_smaller_budget/,20,2021-01-21,"I haven‚Äôt really found any concrete information from people sharing their buying/collection strategy for NBA Top Shot so I thought I would share mine in the hopes it helps others. 

It was fairly basic and I‚Äôm still learning, but this is how I‚Äôve approached the initial part of building my collection. It‚Äôs certainly not advanced but I found some nice results with it so far:  


* Went after LE rookie moments (All 4000LE)
   * Went after Ball, Halliburton, Wiseman, Edwards, Maxey and P Williams. 
   * Got as low serial # as I could on each that looked like value. 
   * These are their very first cards (rookie badges will be implemented soon which will help value). 
   * Some of the biggest room for growth / some will turn into stars, some won‚Äôt.   


I used this strategy as I could acquire them all at low cost. I didn‚Äôt go after elite players because:

1. I didn‚Äôt have the knowledge of the platform to find the values for all of the elite players  
2. I only had a small budget.   


After this I just kind of sat and consumed the platform for a while. Again, I don‚Äôt know if it was the best strategy, but I‚Äôve made some big gains on these guys already and was something my instinct said to go after. 

From there I‚Äôve been focusing on the trying to find the value in other areas. Again don‚Äôt have a big budget, so I‚Äôve been looking through all the series 1 common cards that are now all LE (between 1000-4000 mints). The price isn‚Äôt huge for these, but you can get super low serial #‚Äôs. For these I‚Äôm looking for 2 things:  


1. Do they have a big ceiling (younger/undervalued)
2. Do they have potential to see big spikes from awards (e.g. MIP, 6th Man, All stars etc.)  


Couple examples of people who fit these categories for me:

* Christian Wood (Still young, playing lights out for HOU, could win MIP and if play continues could be an All star)
* Jerami Grant (Candidate for MIP, breaking records for Detroit, top 15 ppg).
* Jordan Clarkson (Still got a while in the league, front runner for 6th man)
* Colin Sexton (Playing super well, really young). Could be an all star in the future.   


I went after these guys series 1 LE commons which were still pretty cheap and got as low serial # as I could (around 20-150).

Thats basically what I‚Äôve been doing and it seems to be doing well so far. I couldn‚Äôt find anyone sharing their strategies so even though mine is pretty basic, I thought I‚Äôd share as it might help anyone else starting out. 

Also found it helpful to get a gage of full league value of players by looking at NBA dynasty league rankings at the very beginning."

Question About Blockchain and NBA Top Shot,6,kzymj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/kzymj5/question_about_blockchain_and_nba_top_shot/,3,2021-01-18,"I only have a very basic understanding of blockchain so I'm wondering if someone can explain how it works with NBA Top Shot.

Let's say there's a moment of a LeBron James' dunk. The edition size is 4000.

1. When Top Shot decides to produce the LeBron Jame's dunk moment, are all 4000 unique serial numbers created?

2. After all 4000 unique serial number moments are created, are they randomly inserted into the packs?

3. For each series there are different releases. Does anything determine what is in a release or is it all random? Like do you have the same odds of getting something in Series 2, Release 1 as you do in Series 2, Release 8?"

PACK POPULATION CONCERNS,7,kzm80m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbatopshot/comments/kzm80m/pack_population_concerns/,12,2021-01-18,"TS just dropped a 50k common pack, probably, to meet consumer demand. But shouldn't this concern the community? 

During the 80s and 90s junk wax era, sportscard companies overproduced to meet consumer demand. The value of those cards subsequently plummeted. 

If TS continues to drop 50k+ common packs, deflationary value action will, most likely, occur. I hope TS sees this and course corrects.

Am I the only one who is concerned?"
